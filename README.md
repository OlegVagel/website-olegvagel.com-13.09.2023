# Oleg Vagel Portfolie, www.olegvagel.com

## Description

This repository includes all files and code used for my personal website.
Certain parts that are not directly in use with my portfolie may not be present. (for example: projects hosted under the same domain of www.olegvagel.com)

## Credits

This Website has been created with Guides from:
- https://www.w3schools.com
- https://ademir.io

Due to the nature of the creation of this website being a learning process, certain code snippets may be very similar to ones presented in the list above.
This Website is subject to constant change, the goal being to be able to create website "from my own".

Thank you :D
